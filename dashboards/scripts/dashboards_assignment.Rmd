## Instructions

This assignment reviews the *Dashboards* analytical lecture. 
You will use the set of *.Rmd* files I reviewed in the video lectures to complete this assignment. 
You will *write* separate *.Rmd* files to create the dashboards described in this file.
You can submit these files to their *Submissions* folder on *D2L*.
You will submit all *.Rmd* files that represent each dashboard to *D2L* by the due date and time.
You will NOT submit any *PDF* this week.

## Flexdashboard 1

Write an **.Rmd** file that creates a flexdashboard with the following specifications.
Name the file **flexdash_1.Rmd**.

The **YAML** heading should contain a title (e.g., **Assignment: Flexdashboards**) and an output specifying a flexdashboard with *source code embedded*, *column orientation*, *scrolling vertical layout*, and *paper theme*. 

Write this flexdashboard WITHOUT shiny.

Write a libraries code chunk that gets excluded (i.e., write **include=FALSE** in the code chunk options) upon rendering the dashboard with the following libraries:

1. **tidyverse**, 
2. **here**, 
3. **flexdashboard**, 
4. **plotly**, 
5. **DT**, and 
6. **rpart**.

Write a data code chunk that gets excluded (i.e., write **include=FALSE** in the code chunk options) upon rendering the dashboard to import the **emp.dat** space-delimited data file.
Save the data as **emp_data**.
In the the same data code chunk, create **emp_samp** from **emp_data** by randomly sampling *1500* employees with **sample_n()**.


Make a single-page flexdashboard consisting of two columns and two rows.

Use **ggplot** on **emp_samp** to make a scatterplot for each of the four slots of the dashboard.
Set **alpha = 0.5** in **geom_point**.

Make **last_evaluation** the y-axis for each of the scatterplots.
For the top-left slot, make **tenure** the x-axis.
For the bottom-left slot, make **number_project** the x-axis.
For the top-right slot, make **avg_month_hours** the x-axis.
For the bottom-right slot, make **job_sat** the x-axis.
Include a smooth **lm** geometry and label the axes correctly for each scatterplot.

Make the title of each slot (note: NOT plot) appropriately descriptive (e.g., write **Performance v. Tenure** after the hash marks for a slot).

Remember, you might need to **Knit to HTML** first before the **Knit to flex_dashboard** option appears.
**Knit to flex_dashboard** once the option appears to see the dashboard.

Again, you will just submit **flexdash_1.Rmd** plus the other four *R Markdown* files you create for this assignment to **D2L**.

## Flexdashboard 2

Use **flexdash_1.Rmd** as the starting point for this flexdashboard.
Name this file **flexdash_2.Rmd**.

Keep the exact same **YAML**, libraries, and data specifications as **flexdash_1.Rmd**. 

Make a flexdashboard consisting of two navigation pages.

On the first navigation page, place the four plots from **flexdash_1.Rmd** into a **tabset**.
Name the navigation page **Plots**.
This navigation page should NOT contain a drop-down menu.

On the second navigation page, make three sub-pages that a user can navigate to via a drop-down menu.
Each sub-page contains a table made with **DT::datatable()** that filters **emp_data** by the three levels of **salary**: **low**, **medium**, and **high**.
Select **emp_id**, **tenure**, **number_project**, **avg_month_hours**, **job_sat**, and **last_evaluation** as the variables to display.
Name the navigation page **Tables**.
Name the sub-pages: **Low Salary**, **Medium Salary**, and **High Salary**.
Enable the table, pagination, scrolling, and length inside **DT::datatable**.

## Flexdashboard 3

Use **flexdash_2.Rmd** as the starting point for this flexdashboard.
Name this file **flexdash_3.Rmd**.

Add a third navigation page consisting of NO sub-pages.
Name the navigation page **Gauges**.

This page should consist of four slots arranged in two columns and two rows.

In the data code chunk, compute the number of employees without and with a work accident in **emp_samp**.
Name the computed objects as **num_wout_work_acc** for number of employees without a work accident and **num_with_work_acc** for number of employees with a work accident.

In the *top-left* slot, make a *value box* that counts the number of employees *without* a work accident.
In the *top-right* slot, make a *value box* that counts the number of employees *with* a work accident.
Add a chart bar icon and use appropriate captions.

In the *bottom-left* slot, make a *gauge* that calculates the percentage of employees *without* a work accident.
In the *bottom-right* slot, make a *gauge* that calculates the percentage of employees *with* a work accident.
Set the minimum and maximum of the gauges to *0* and *100*, respectively.
Set the gauge sectors to **90-100** for **success**, **50-89** for **warning**, and **0-49** for **danger**.

## Flexdashboard 4

Use **flexdash_3.Rmd** as the starting point for this flexdashboard.
Name this file **flexdash_4.Rmd**.

Remove the **vertical_layout** from the **YAML** header.

Add a fourth navigation *storyboard* page consisting of two sub-pages.
Name the navigation page **Predictions**.
Name the storyboard tiles **Evalute Accuracy of a Decision Tree for Turnover Predictions** and **Evaluate Accuracy of OLS Regression for Performance Predictions**.

In the data code chunk, create **emp_train** and **emp_test** from **emp_data** by randomly sampling *65%* of employees from **emp_data** to create **emp_train** and the remaining employees forming **emp_test**.

For the first storyboard tile, use the code from the analytical lecture to make a bar plot showing the prediction accuracy of a *decision tree model* to predict **left** trained on **emp_train** and evaluated on **emp_test**.
Use **rpart()** to form a decision tree model to predict **left** from all predictors except for **emp_id**.

For the second storyboard tile, use the code from the analytical lecture to make a scatterplot showing the prediction accuracy of an *ordinary least-squares regression model* to predict **last_evaluation** trained on **emp_train** and evaluated on **emp_test**.
Use **lm()** to form an ordinary least-squares regression model to predict **last_evaluation** from all predictors except for **emp_id**.

Include storyboard notes for each sub-page.

## Flexdashboard 5

This dashboard is *not* required to complete this assignment and receive 100% on it.
This is just an extra challenge for fun!

Use **flexdash_4.Rmd** as the starting point for this flexdashboard.
Name this file **flexdash_5.Rmd**.

Add **runtime: shiny** to the **YAML** section.

Add a **sidebar** page to create a *slider input* that controls how many employees are sampled from **emp_data** to compute everything in the flexdashboard.
Make the minimum and maximum of the slider *1000* and *5000*, respectively, with a default value of *3000* and steps of *500*.

Note, you will keep the importing of **emp_data** in the data code chunk.
However, you will move all other code in the data code chunk to the new sidebar code chunk and make required adjustments for shiny reactivity.

Adjust the code in **flexdash_4.Rmd** as required in order to make the flexdashboard reactive to changes in the slider input for all computations.
See the lecture script for guidance.
